This project is the Mac OS System configuration for the Macbook from Robin, always running the latest Mac OS Version. This script utilizes Nix to setup a Mac Os System with the mandatory functions a developer needs in his day to day work. 

The project is splitted apart into home and system
- Home contains specific feature configurations and the "SW-KV6CYPFQL4.nix" file. "SW-KV6CYPFQL4" is the computer name.
- Systems is used to configure and set the features
